This is my portfolio built on Ubraco 10 technology, which itself integrates .NET 6 and ASP.NET Core
.Net 6 and newer versions are required and recommended, you can visit https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/
To run Sources, open the downloaded file and run the following command at the command prompt
(dotnet watch run) If of course you have installed the .net mentioned above, the site will run locally,
 it will take about 5 minutes, maybe when running in the browser, the browser will mark that this file is not protected, just open it to view.

If you want to open umbraco local site then use login and password
